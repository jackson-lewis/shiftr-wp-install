# Shape Shiftr

A WordPress starter theme built for superior performance and experience.

This theme has evolved inline with my own personal progression as a WordPress developer, with significant improvements such as introducing ACF via PHP in the form of Shiftr ACF, which is the backbone behind the current 3rd-generation Flexi Blocks Builder.

## Performance
Superior performance has always been at the heart of Shiftr, baking performance-led decisions into the very core of the theme is what allows some of the very best possible performance milestones to be achieved for a WordPress site.

With the likes of preload support for featured images of posts builtin, and careful handling of image sizes and lazy load options, the only remaining step for optimising images is use of a Image Optimsation Service.

## Experience
It is easy with WordPress development to put 100% focus in the frontend, that the experience of the backend can become very poor for content editors and administrators. With the likes of the Flexi Blocks Builder, Shiftr cares deeply about the experience for content entry, making for a fully _flexible_ solution to tailor pages based on the editors needs.

During development, the theme is powered by Gulp for hot reloading and compiling of styles. Webpack then handles transpiling all JavaScript. The build has been carefully created, making sure the hot reloads are ultra fast. It was also crutial that styles where injected rather than reloads, adding to the experience further. Development mode does not mess around trying to minify code when it's not needed, boosting reload times further.
